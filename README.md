### simple_calc
Simple calculator can add or substract numbers from 00 to 99; leading zeros are necessary and operation mark must be beetween numbers. Only natural results are supported. Substracting bigger number from smaller evaluates to incorrect results.
Examples of valid input:
00+99
99+99
65-09

### algorithms
Some simple algoritms in BrainFuck which were used by me during that crazy night. Mostly created by me but [Esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck_algorithms) helped me a lot.
